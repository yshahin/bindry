Turning a regular PDF into a physical book requires a process called **Imposition**. This rearranges pages so that when they are printed on flat sheets and folded, they appear in the correct numberical order.

Our [Bindery Tool](/tool) handles this mathematics for you automatically. Here is how to use it.

### Step 1: Prepare Your PDF

Before uploading, ensure your PDF meets these simple criteria:
*   **Sequential Order**: Pages should be in reading order (1, 2, 3...) not already imposed.
*   **Consistent Size**: All pages should ideally be the same dimensions (e.g., A5 or Half Letter).
*   **Page Count**: It works best if your total page count is a multiple of 4, but the tool will add blank pages automatically if needed.

### Step 2: Upload Your File

Navigate to the **Tool** page. You will see a large upload area.

Drag and drop your PDF file onto the target area, or click "Select PDF" to browse your computer. The tool processes the file locally in your browser—your document is never sent to a server, ensuring privacy.

### Step 3: Configure Your Bindery Settings

Once loaded, you will see the configuration panel. These settings determine how your book is constructed.

#### Sheets per Signature
This is the most critical setting for binders. A **signature** is a group of folded sheets nested together.
*   **Standard (4 Sheets / 16 Pages)**: Good for general purpose text weight paper (20lb/80gsm).
*   **Thick Paper (2-3 Sheets)**: Use fewer sheets if your paper is thick to prevent "creep" (where inner pages stick out).
*   **Single Signature**: If you are making a pamphlet or simple notebook, you can set this to cover the entire page count.

#### Page Range
You can choose to process only a specific chapter or section of your PDF using the "Start Page" and "End Page" sliders.

#### Reading Direction
Select **LTR** (Left-to-Right) for English, Spanish, etc., or **RTL** for languages like Arabic or Hebrew. The tool attempts to auto-detect this, but you can override it manually.

### Step 4: Preview and Generate

The **Booklet Preview** visualize how your signatures will look. You can see:
*   **Signature Count**: How many distinct bundles you will need to sew.
*   **Blank Pages**: Any blanks added to the end to complete the final signature.

When you are satisfied, click **Download Booklet PDF**.

### Step 5: Printing

The generated PDF is formatted for **Duplex Printing (Short-Edge Binding)**.
1.  Open the file in your PDF viewer.
2.  Select "Print on both sides of paper".
3.  Choose **Flip on Short Edge**.
4.  Ensure "Actual Size" or "Scale 100%" is selected so margins aren't distorted.

Once printed, simply fold each sheet in half, group them by signature, and you are ready to bind!
